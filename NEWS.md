Bazecor 0.2.0
=============

## New features

- Bazecor ships with an updated keyboard firmware, with new features, and plenty
  of bugfixes. Upgrading the firmware is highly recommended.
- With the new firmware, we're now recommending the use of "Move To Layer" keys
  instead of "Lock To Layer", because the former is easier to understand. Using
  it requires the new firmware.
- It is now possible to adjust the brightness of the LEDs.
- The idle time after which the LEDs shut off are also configurable now.
- The Preferences and Keyboard settings screens have been merged into a single
  Preferences screen.
- It is now possible to flash firmware onto a Raise in programmable mode.

## Bugfixes

- A lot of minor and major issues have been fixed, such as frequent white
  screens under certain conditions.
- Flashing has been made more stable and reliable.
- Notifications are dismissable again.
- It is now possible to get back to the keyboard selection screen, and even
  disconnect from the Raise.
- The "Software update" menu entry has been disabled - coming soon!

## Miscellaneous

- The application language cannot be changed anymore. We'll be doing
  translations in a different way, and the feature will be coming back then.
- Dark mode has been temporarily removed, until we iron out the quirks and make
  it usable. It's not worth having it when many important parts of the interface
  are almost invisible due to bad contrast.
- The Leader, SpaceCadet, Mouse warp and Steno keys are no longer offered by the
  key config popup.
- Dual-use functionality are no longer available for modifiers, because they do
  not make sense.
- The key config popup has been cleaned up, and rearranged.

## Known issues

- Due to unforeseen issues, we cannot provide pre-built binaries for OSX at this
  time.
